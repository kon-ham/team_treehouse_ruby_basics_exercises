- Assign the number 2 to the variables integer and float. But there's a catch: the value in integer needs to have a class of Integer. But the value in float needs to have a class of Float.

    ```
    integer = 2
    float = 2.0
    ```

- Multiply 25 times 3 and assign the result to a variable named product. Then divide 7 by 4 and assign the result to a variable named quotient.

    ```
    product = 25 * 3
    quotient = 7.0 / 4
    ```

- We've assigned the string "123" to a variable named string. Take string, use a method to convert it to an integer, and store the result in a variable named integer. Then call a second method on string to convert it to a floating-point number, and store the result in a variable named float.

    ```
    string = "123"
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    integer = string.to_i

    float = string.to_f
    ```

- Choose the result of this Ruby expression: (2 + 4) * 6

    `36`

- Choose the result of this Ruby expression: 7 / 4

    `1 (Because Ruby assumes you are trying to divide between two INTEGER classes`

- Choose the result of this Ruby expression: 7 / 4.0

    `1.75`

- Choose the output of this code: puts "7" * 3

    `777`
