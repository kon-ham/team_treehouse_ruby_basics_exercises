- Assign the number 2 to the variables integer and float. But there's a catch: the value in integer needs to have a class of Integer. But the value in float needs to have a class of Float.

    ```
    integer = 2
    float = 2.0
    ```

- Multiply 25 times 3 and assign the result to a variable named product. Then divide 7 by 4 and assign the result to a variable named quotient.

    ```
    product = 25 * 3
    quotient = 7.0 / 4
    ```
