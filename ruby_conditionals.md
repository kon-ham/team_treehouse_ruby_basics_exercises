- Using comparison operators, test whether the number 2 is less than the number 3. (We know, it is, but see if you can express that in code.) Pass the result to puts. Then test whether the number 5 is greater than the number 6. Pass that result to puts as well.

    ```
    puts 2 < 3

    puts 5 > 6
    ```
