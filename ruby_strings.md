- Using string concatenation, join the strings "Ruby" and "rocks!" together. Be sure to include a space between "Ruby" and "rocks!". Then print the result using puts.

    `puts "Ruby" + " " + "rocks!"`

- Call puts with a string containing a newline character. Then call puts with a string containing a tab character. Finally, call puts a third time with a string containing a " double quotation mark.

    ```
    # puts a new line character
    puts "\n"

    # puts a new tab character
    puts "\t"

    # puts a new quotation character
    puts "\""
    ```
